# CWG Audition Project

Analyzing the Eastern Pacific Oscillation 
The EPO is a key teleconnection for U.S. weather patterns, especially in the winter. This two-part project  develops a quick climatology tool to help the CWG forecasters with EPO baseline expectations and starts  the planning process for ideas for subseasonal forecasting support. 

# Part One: EPO Climatology 
We are sending you the historical daily .csv file for the EPO index back to 1950. We would like to  develop a climatology baseline for this to determine historical-based probabilities for different times of  the year for extreme events like one and two standard deviations +EPO and -EPO occurrences. Please write a program that does this, that would be designed to update daily with new EPO information, and  make the code and output available to the CWG team.

# Part Two: Developing an EPO Long-Lead Indicator 
In 500 words or less, please describe potential strategies we could employ to develop probabilistic  expectations for EPO in the subseasonal 16-30 day outlook (weeks 3-4) space. Include thoughts (1)  unknowns/assumptions, (2) possible challenges, and (3) on required resources such as  time/compute/storage. Include potential ML algorithms that could be best suited to solve this problem  with any potential drawbacks too.
